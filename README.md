This was an university solo test, we were asked to make a table where we could register tasks on a Mongo database and display them on the site.

This project was made using NodeJS and MongoDB.

I scored a 10/10 even adding some extra details, unfortunately because i dont own a host, i can't have the database up and running to display, but feel free download it and start it locally(Changing to your own Mongo Cluster) and see it up and running without any problem, its all configured.
